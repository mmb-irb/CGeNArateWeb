# CGeNArateWeb

<div align="center"><img src="logo.png" /></div>

We present **CGeNArateWeb**, an intuitive environment for simulation of both unconstrained and constrained DNA, such as **circular DNA** and **protein-DNA** simulations. The simulations are obtained using [**CGeNArate**](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/12/6791/7685160), a new model for molecular dynamics simulations for **B-DNA** in the context of biotechnological or **chromatin** studies. The developed method uses a coarse-grained Hamiltonian with trajectories that are back-mapped to the atomistic resolution. The method is sequence-dependent and reproduces very well **not only local**, but also **global physical properties of DNA**, while its performance exceeds common molecular dynamics simulations by several orders of magnitude.
